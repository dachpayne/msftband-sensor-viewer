# Band 2 Sensor Viewer
Connect your Band over Bluetooth and view it's sensor information. Used to test the Band NuGet package on Windows 10. Works on both Desktop and Mobile SKUs

Pair your Band in Bluetooth settings, and update it's firmware using the Microsoft Band app before using this app. 

*Some sensors require a Band 2, however basic ones such as the accelerometer are brightness are supported by both the Band 1 (flat screen, all black) and Band 2  (curved OLED, black sides, silver screen.)*
